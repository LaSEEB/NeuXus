Welcome to NeuXus' documentation!
=================================

NeuXus is a modular software written in Python that allows to easily create and execute pipelines in real time. NeuXus is specifically designed for BCI real-time processing and classification.

It offers a lot of possibilities, many basic functions are already implemented so that the first pipelines can be quickly created. For more specific functions, users can develop and use their own functions.
